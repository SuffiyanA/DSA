# DSA
Data Algorithms And Structures Practice Codes

This repository serves the purpose of storing coding problems in DSA courses. Topics include, but are not limited to:

  *Creating linked lists
  
  *Creating stacks through arrays/linked lists
  
  *Creating qeueus through arrays/linked lists
  
  
Each rpogram will be initially written in C language, but codes in other language can be added as well.

Hope this helps!
